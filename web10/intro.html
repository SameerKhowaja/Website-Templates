        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="description1">I'm a 20 year old game and web designer/developer working out as a Freelancer. I have been coding since I was 9th grade at school. Fast-forward a few years later I was landing freelance projects most of friends. During this time I was also
                working on my other skills like playing football, table tennis and also love cooking.</p>

            <p id="description2">I am currently enrolled in my Bachelor Degree Program at National University FAST in major of Computer Science. In my university I have polished my skills and also learned some new ones too. I have also take active parts in programming competitions
                like Coders Cup, Dev Day and more. I am also one time winner of Coders Cup in 2018.</p>

        <section id="WhyIamDifferent">
            <h2>Why I am Different?</h2>
            <p id="description3">I am a very good communicator and find it's easy for me to relate to other people. Also I really enjoy learning new things and am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities.</p>

            <p id="description4">Moreover, I'm not afraid of failure. In fact, I think it is an essential part of the experimental process that gets you to success.</p>

        <section id="WhatcanIContribute">
            <h2>What can I Contribute?</h2>
            <p id="description5">I can contribute my ability to streamline office processes. For example, I developed a new method for scheduling client appointments which led to an 85% decrease in scheduling errors. I would love to bring not only this method, but my general
                organizational skills to this job at your company.</p>
